RGB-Mixer is a basic RGB LED colour mixer for nanpy (https://github.com/nanpy/nanpy) and the Raspberry Pi
(though the latter isn't required). 

nanpy makes it easy and fun to write Python code for fast prototyping with Arduino. Check it out!

Simply configure 3 potentiometers with your Arduino board and an RGB LED (or seperate red, green & LEDs).

Use the functions to mix your own colours using the pots, or set any colour combination manually.
